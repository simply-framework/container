# Dependency Injection Container #

This package provides a [PSR-11](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-11-container.md)
compatible dependency injection container that relies heavily on PHP 
configuration via scalar arrays rather than anonymous functions.

The container also implements container delegation pattern as described in
[container-interop](https://github.com/container-interop/container-interop/blob/master/docs/Delegate-lookup.md)
standard.
